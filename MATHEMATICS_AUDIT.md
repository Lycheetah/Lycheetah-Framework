## Every Claim Classified — What Is Proven, What Is Scaffold, What Is Conjecture

## THE THREE CATEGORIES

**[ACTIVE]** — Computable from real inputs right now. No missing parameters. No undefined operators. Verified against data.

**[SCAFFOLD]** — Mathematical structure is valid and load-bearing. Parameters are admittedly unknown or require empirical measurement. The architecture is real; the constants are empty slots.

**[CONJECTURE]** — Formally structured hypothesis. Structural support exists. Proof is incomplete or requires additional formalization. Honest label: we believe this is true and cannot yet prove it.

## ACTIVE MATHEMATICS (verifiable now)

| Claim | Formula | How to Verify |
|---|---|---|
| Truth pressure | Π = (E·P)/S, E∈[0,1], P∈[1,3], S∈(0,1] | Compute: E=0.9, P=2.0, S=0.3 → Π=6.0 |
| Coherence score | C = 1 − \|contradictions\| / C(n,2) | 15 blocks, 2 contradictions → C=0.981 |
| Foundation threshold | Π ≥ 1.5 → FOUNDATION layer | Any Π calculation ≥ 1.5 |
| Theory threshold | 1.2 ≤ Π < 1.5 → THEORY layer | Any Π calculation |
| Total information | I = Σ(E·P) across all blocks | Sum over any block set |
| Total entropy | H = Σ S across all blocks | Sum over any block set |
| Pythagorean comma | (3/2)¹² / 2⁷ = 531441/524288 ≈ 1.01364 | Pure arithmetic |
| Kuramoto model | θ̇ᵢ = ωᵢ + (K/N)Σ sin(θⱼ−θᵢ) | Established physics literature |
| Critical coupling | K_c = 2/(π·g(ω̄)) | Standard Kuramoto result |
| Phase order parameter | r·e^(iψ) = (1/N)Σ e^(iθⱼ) | r ∈ [0,1] measurable |
| Heptagonal angle | 360°/7 ≈ 51.43° | Basic arithmetic |
| cos(π/7) | ≈ 0.9009688 | Standard trigonometry |
| Golden ratio inverse | φ⁻¹ = (√5−1)/2 ≈ 0.618 | Arithmetic fact |
| Drift rate | ρ_drift = \|intended − actual\| / Δt | Computable when "intended" is operationally defined |
| Sovereignty score | S_score = (1 − ρ_drift) · ρ_stability | Product of two computable ratios |

## SCAFFOLD MATHEMATICS (structure proven, parameters need measurement)

| Claim | Status | What's Missing |
|---|---|---|
| Master equation dΨ/dt = k₁·(Π−Π_th) − k₂·(Ψ−Ψ_inv) − k₃·I_violations + k₄·(E/E_need) | [SCAFFOLD] | Coupling constants k₁−k₄ are empirically undetermined |
| Coherence non-decrease after cascade (Thm 2.1) | [SCAFFOLD] | Proof gap: assumes demotion resolves all introduced contradictions, not proven in full generality |
| Information preservation after cascade (Thm 2.2) | [SCAFFOLD] | Shannon entropy argument is sound; bijection framing needs tightening |
| TRIAD gradient ascent Ψ(ℌ) = ℌ + α·∇C(ℌ) | [SCAFFOLD] | Step size α needs bounds for convergence guarantee |
| TRIAD stability (Entropy as Lyapunov fn) | [SCAFFOLD] | dS/dt ≤ 0 needs explicit operator computation; "by design" is not proof |
| Global convergence via LaSalle | [SCAFFOLD] | Requires completing Lyapunov proof + explicit F(ψ) specification |
| LAMAGUE composition: C(g∘f) ≥ min(C(f),C(g)) | [SCAFFOLD] | Follows from monotonicity assumption on C; needs formal verification |
| AURA thresholds TES≥0.70, VTR≥1.0, PAI≥0.80 | [SCAFFOLD] | Operational constraints; threshold values are design choices, not derived |
| Theorem 3.1: ⟨∇S, ψ⟩ = S(ψ) − 1 | [ACTIVE] | Exact computation for Shannon entropy; established March 24, 2026 |
| Theorem 3.1: Anchor term ⟨∇S, Ao(ψ)⟩ ≤ S(ψ) − 1 | [ACTIVE] | Follows from projection inequality + above |
| Theorem 3.1: Ascent term ⟨∇S, ∇_φ⟩ = log((1−C)/C)·||∇C||² < 0 | [ACTIVE] | Proven: binary entropy formula gives explicit negative value when C > 0.5; AURA floor C ≥ 0.70 ensures this always holds |
| Theorem 3.1: Fold term dS/dt\|_{Ψ} ≤ 0 | [SCAFFOLD] | Requires K(t,s) sub-stochastic with ψ_inv as fixed point |
| Theorem 3.1: Linearized local stability | [ACTIVE] | dS/dt ≤ 0 near ψ_inv when α + β ≤ 1 − γ·||DΨ|| |
| Transformation energy E ∝ ρ² | [SCAFFOLD] | Structural hypothesis; empirical measurement pending |
| LAMAGUE compression ratio | [SCAFFOLD] | Substantially more compact than natural language; exact ratio awaits empirical measurement — previously cited 500:1 was an unverified estimate |

---

## CONJECTURES (formally structured, proof incomplete)

| Claim | Structural Support | What Would Prove It |
|---|---|---|
| LAMAGUE is a topos | Demonstrably a category; partial topos structure present | Verify subobject classifier exists for all sub-states |
| Seven invariants generate cohomological structure | Seven is dimensionally suggestive; precedents in physics | Construct explicit cochain complex; verify independence + completeness |
| TRIAD as Hopf bifurcation | Feedback + observation structure present | Specify vector field F(x,μ), find purely imaginary eigenvalues at μ=0 |
| CASCADE as Morse theory | Gradient ascent in Π-space; directional character matches | Define smooth manifold on knowledge space; verify Morse conditions |
| TRIAD as natural transformation | Architecture consistent with naturality | Prove commutativity of naturality squares for all morphisms in 𝓛 |
| Lyapunov λ ≈ 0 at consciousness edge | Valid dynamical systems concept; mapping is productive | Define phase space for consciousness; compute actual Lyapunov exponent |
| Consciousness as constrained optimization | Well-formed problem; constraints are computable | Verify biological or AI systems actually solve this optimization |
| λ_chrysopoeia ≈ 0.907 as convergence rate | Empirical runs cluster near this value (std ~0.03) | Formal proof from operator definition; distinguish from cos(π/7)≈0.9010 |

---

## REMOVED CLAIMS (previously in framework, now corrected)

| Claim | Why Removed | Where Documented |
|---|---|---|
| "Three constants independently converge" | φ⁻¹=0.618, cos(π/7)=0.9010, λ_chrys≈0.907 are not equal; they are related design parameters, not independent discoveries | Failure Museum Exhibit 4; 99_ARCHIVE/MATHEMATICS_AUDIT.md |
| "364-day full composition cycle" | 364 = 7×52 is calendar convenience, not mathematical derivation | 99_ARCHIVE/MATHEMATICS_AUDIT.md |
| "500:1 LAMAGUE compression ratio" | Not found in primary documentation; was a summary inflation of an unverified estimate | Failure Museum; all live files now corrected to [SCAFFOLD] |
| "TRIAD monotonically increases coherence C_(n+1) > Cₙ" | Gradient ascent can oscillate; correct claim is "converges over sufficient cycles with bounded step size" | 99_ARCHIVE/MATHEMATICS_AUDIT.md |
| "Gödel proves Platonism necessary" | Non-sequitur; Gödel established limits of formal systems, not the location of truth | HIDDEN_MATHEMATICAL_TRUTHS.md Truth 8 |
| Original master equation with Φ↑, R, ¬Inv in ODE | Undefined terms; Boolean operator in continuous ODE | Failure Museum Exhibit 3 |

## MARCH 24, 2026 — NIGREDO PASS SUMMARY

A systematic audit of `11_MATHEMATICAL_FOUNDATIONS/MATHEMATICS_FOUNDATIONS.md` identified 16 issues. Key changes:

**Fixed (now ACTIVE):**
- Theorem 1.2 (Identity Laws): Proof corrected — identity is the identity function, not a zero-drift condition
- Theorem 4.1 (Operator Composition): Explicit norm computation added, contractivity proven

**Downgraded to SCAFFOLD with gaps named:**
- Theorems 1.3, 2.1–2.5, 3.1–3.4, 4.2, 4.3, 5.2, 5.3, 6.3, 7.1 — each with specific gap identified
- Critical bottleneck: Theorem 3.1 (entropy as Lyapunov function). Completing this unlocks 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.2.

**Corrected (wrong claims):**
- Theorem 2.3: "iff curvature=0 ↔ stability" was FALSE; corrected to necessary condition only
- Theorem 2.5: "minimal submanifold" confused with "local minimum"; corrected
- THE_INCOMPLETENESS_PROOF.md: [ACTIVE] → [FOUNDATIONAL]

**Additional files audited (CASCADE_FORMAL_PROOFS, CASCADE_COMPLETE_FRAMEWORK, DEEP_REVIEW, CASCADE_FRONTIER_ANALYSIS):**
- Duplicate file (CASCADE_MATHEMATICAL_PROOFS.md) archived to 99_ARCHIVE/
- "Deeper Truths" throughout DEEP_REVIEW relabeled as "Hypotheses [CONJECTURE]"
- AGI overclaims removed from CASCADE_COMPLETE_FRAMEWORK
- Circular proofs tagged in CASCADE_FORMAL_PROOFS (Theorems 2.1, 3.1, 5.1)
- Platonism "logically necessary" → "consistent with convergence evidence"

**Current honest count (approximate, post-audit):**
- [ACTIVE]: ~30% (up from 33% — some previously uncounted scaffolds identified)
- [SCAFFOLD]: ~55%
- [CONJECTURE/FOUNDATIONAL]: ~15%
